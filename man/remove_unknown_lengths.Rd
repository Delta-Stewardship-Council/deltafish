\title{Remove unknown fish lengths}
\usage{
remove_unknown_lengths(data, univariate)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{An arrow dataset of fish data. See \code{open_fish()}}

\item{univariate}{(logical) Will these data be used for univariate analyses
(\code{univariate=TRUE})? Or multi-species analyses (\code{univariate=FALSE})?
If univariate, when a \code{Length_NA_flag=="Unknown length"} record is found,
all records of that taxa from that sample are removed. In effect, this is
transforming those records into missing data. If \code{univariate=FALSE}, when
a \code{Length_NA_flag=="Unknown length"} record is found, the entire sample
is removed and no 0s are filled in, since accurate community data cannot be
confirmed for that sample.}
}
\value{
data_known An arrow dataset with only known lenghts
}
\description{
Removes unknown fish lengths. Returns an arrow dataset.
